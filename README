Very, very useful program wich sort by kind your movie collection.
The reference is Allocin√©.

Just run it with your python command:

$ python filmordener.py [dir/of/your/movie/collection] [debug=0|debug=1 (if 1 then debug is on and consol mode is triggered)]

or by doucle-clicking on the file in your file explorer thanks it's a GUI application.
